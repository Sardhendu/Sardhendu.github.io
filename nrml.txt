<h2> Projects Ongoing: </h2>

-----------------

#### Property Classification [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/PropertyClassification)
This project is aimed to classify the type of property (Land/House) given a "Address string" or a "real-estate property image". Data is collected and integrated from several sources. Building boundaries are collected from **Open Street Map (OSM)** and Satellite, Aerial, Streetside images are collected from **Google Maps** and **Bing Maps**. Concepts of Semantic Segmentation and model emsembles are employed to output the best prediction given image types.

##### Skills developed: Python, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, GeoPandas, Shapely, TensorFlow (GPU), Keras, Geojson, Azure Cloud stack

-----------

#### Credit Card Fraud [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/CreditCardFraudDetection)
This project is aimed to identify credit card frauds. Pattern Recognition techniques such as **Bagging and Boosting with Trees**, **Deep Neural Nets**, **Autoencoders** and **Parallelized Bayesian nets** are evaluated. The dataset is collected from Kaggle. As a outcome the models parameters are tuned to have high performance in identifying fraud cases.

##### Skills developed: Python, R, TensorFlow,

<h2> Projects Accomplished </h2>

-------------------------

#### Deep Face Recognition [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/DeepFaceRecognition)
This application leverages Transfer Learning with Google Net (NN4 small) architecture to recognize faces given an image. It employs a multi-step approach, 1) Extracting all the faces from an image, 2) Labeling the faces with the person name. The application implements ideas from the paper [Facenet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf).

##### Skills developed: Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV

----------------

#### CIFAR-10 Object Recognition [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/CIFAR10-Object-Recognition)
This project was aimed to evaluate a mix of several Deep Learning, Image Processing and Machine Learning models to classify an object in an image. The data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10). For the sake of simplicity and to evaluate the algorithms, only 2 classes were used.

##### Skills developed: Python, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Tensorflow

-----------------

#### Diabetic-Readmission Analysis [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Diabetic-Readmission/DiabeticReadmission-Spark.ipynb)
This project was aimed to analyze the factors led to the early re-admission of a diabetic patient. In addition, the model was trained to predict whether a diabetic patient would be re-admitted within the next 30 days. The data set was collected from [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and implements idea from the [paper](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/) published by the authors. The data analysis pipeline was build using Py-Spark.

##### Skills developed: Python, Py-Spark (MLlib)

-----------------

#### Crime Rate Prediction [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Diabetic-Readmission/DiabeticReadmission-Spark.ipynb)
This project was aimed to experiment and evaluate several Machine Learning algorithms. The classification task was to classify whether a locality was high crime zone or low crime zone and the regression task was to predict the crime rate.

##### Skills developed: Python, Scikit-learn

------------------

#### License Plate Extraction [*Link*](https://github.com/Sardhendu/License-Plate-Detection):
This project was aimed to detect and extract license plates of vehicles (4-wheelers) given an image. It takes a multi-step approach, 1) Using several Image processing techniques we extract all contours (Region of interests) from the image and 2) We classify each extracted regions as License Plates or Non-license Plates.

##### Skills developed: Python, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
